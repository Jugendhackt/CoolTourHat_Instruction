# Coutributing to the HowToPGP project

We are always happy about [pull requests](https://github.com/Jugendhackt/HowToPGP/pulls) from everyone!

No matter what kind of contribution - large or small. If you want to help but you are not sure what to add, here is a small list of features that realy would bring the projekt foreward.
You can also look at the [issue page](https://github.com/Jugendhackt/HowToPGP/issues) for more ideas.

##Instructions

The aim of our project is to cover as many systems as possible, so new instructions are always an great improvement. There are also
instructions that are not completed yet. You can help by completing the Android and the Mailvelpoe instructions.

The instruction text files can be found in [HowToPGP/include/descriptions-lang](https://github.com/Jugendhackt/HowToPGP/tree/master/include).
Please orientate at the exsiting instructions. Name the files like that: __client_instructionpart_os_level.html__ for example __thunderbird_install_l_technical.html__.
Add the .html files in [here](https://github.com/Jugendhackt/HowToPGP/blob/master/page.appcache).

##Translation

We want to make this website aviable in multible languages. At the moment our Website is aviable in English and German. Sometimes there are 
parts of the instruction that are not translated in one of this languages. Just look for files that exists in the descriptions-de folder but not in
the descriptions-en folder or vice versa. A very big improvement would be a translation in new language. For a translation in a new language create a new folder in 
[HowToPGP/include/](https://github.com/Jugendhackt/HowToPGP/tree/master/include) and name it __descriptions-lang__. Please do not translate the
name of the files. For a translation of the mainpage add a new .json file in [HowToPGP/locale/](https://github.com/Jugendhackt/HowToPGP/tree/master/locale) and name it
 __lang.json__.
